## 🎬 **Sentinema: Sentiment-Driven Interpretation of Movie Reviews**

**Sentinema** is an open-source project that connects **quantitative movie ratings** with **the qualitative emotional reactions of audiences**.  
Using the **IMDb Movie Reviews dataset (Kaggle)**, the system identifies **sentiment polarity (positive/negative)** and extracts **dominant emotional keywords** to reveal *what* viewers liked or disliked — not just *how much* they liked it.

### 🌟 **Why Sentinema?**
Traditional sentiment models or recommendation systems usually output only a numeric score.  
**Sentinema goes further by visualizing the reasons behind the score.**

Rather than presenting *“Rating: 8.1”*, Sentinema explains:  
> *“Viewers praised the cinematography and soundtrack, but criticized the pacing.”*

This enables:
- 🎥 Researchers and critics to understand audience perception trends  
- 📈 Platform operators to analyze satisfaction drivers  
- 🤖 Developers to build transparent sentiment-aware recommendation systems
