Sentiment + Cinema : Sentiment analysis of Movie reviews

Sentinema is an open-source project that bridges quantitative movie ratings and qualitative audience emotions.
Using the IMDb Movie Reviews dataset from Kaggle, the system extracts sentiment polarity (positive/negative)
and key emotional keywords for each movie, then visualizes results with interactive charts and word clouds.

Unlike traditional sentiment models or recommendation systems that output only numeric scores,
Sentinema highlights why audiences liked or disliked a movie through interpretable sentiment visualization.
